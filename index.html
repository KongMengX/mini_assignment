    <p>I really like ducks because I feel like they are a very versatile animal. Ducks can be ruthless savages that chase you into a corner, much like geese.</p>
    <p>However, they can also be seen as one of the more cuter animals on the internet, along side with cats, and dogs. I personally find ducks to be very cute and are great animals to draw.</p><br>
